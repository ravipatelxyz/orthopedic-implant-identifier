
Format of radiograph images before running any code should be as follows:

1. All images are unilateral anterior-posterior x-ray images and saved in png format
2. Images should be named in the following format, ##_****.png, where ## refers to the implant 
model (as per coding below), and **** is an image index (unique for every image in dataset).  
E.g. 04_0306.png is implant model 08 (Stryker Exeter), and the the 306th image in the whole dataset
