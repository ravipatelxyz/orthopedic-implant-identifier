## Developing a neural network to identify the model of orthopedic implant in an x-ray image
##### AIMINN stands for: Automated Identification of Metallic Implants using Neural Networks

#### Context

Accurate identification of orthopedic implant design is essential to pre-operative planning of revision arthroplasty. Current systems are inadequate, associated with poorer patient surgical outcomes, significant time burdens on clinical staff, and increased healthcare costs.

We have therefore developed a neural network classifier for identifying the model of metallic joint implants from plain film radiographs (x-ray images), and are publishing our findings. We have made all code and the full dataset of radiographs available through Kaggle Kernels to facilitate interactive use. The code covers all stages of development, training, and evaluation phases of the study, to facilitate other researchers to build upon this work, and use PyTorch machine learning framework. This GitHub repository also contains old implementations done in Keras machine learning framework, though please note there are substantial differences between this and final PyTorch version. We are making both versions available just in case this is valuable for others working on this problem.  We hope this will facilitate the development of a clinically applicable network classifier for identifying orthopedic implants in x-ray images.

#### Content

All code is in ipynb format to enable viewing in Jupyter Notebooks. All code was written using Python 3.7.

#### To interact with our final model

Please visit the Kaggle Kernel for the final PyTorch implementation and Kaggle Dataset, where we have made our final model and test dataset radiographs available for interactive use.
