## Developing a neural network to identify the model of orthopedic implant in an x-ray image

#### Context

Accurate identification of orthopedic implant design is essential to pre-operative planning of revision arthroplasty and verification of magnetic resonance imaging compatibility. Current systems are inadequate, associated with poorer patient surgical outcomes, significant time burdens on clinical staff, and increased healthcare costs.

We have therefore developed a neural network classifier for identifying the model of metallic joint implants from plain film radiographs (x-ray images), and have published our findings. We have made the final model and a set of radiographs available on Kaggle Kernels for interactive use.  This GitHub repository contains code used in the development, training, and evaluation phases of the study, to facilitate other researchers build upon this work.  We hope this will facilitate the development of a clinically applicable network classifier for identifying orthopedic implants in x-ray images.

#### Content

This dataset contains:
1. FINAL_MODEL - code (ipynb file), h5 files, and examplar radiographs for implementing and playing with our final model. Note that the final model is probably best viewed in Kaggle Kernels where it has also been made available for interactive use.
2. MODEL_DEVELOPMENT - code used in the process of developing our model. All code is in ipynb format to enable viewing in Jupyter Notebooks.  Detailed explanations of each ipynb file are included in the markup within each file.  All ipynb code files are numbered according to the order in which they are run.  I have tried to make it clear where it will be necessary to modify the code to work in your own environment.
